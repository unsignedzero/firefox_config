## Firefox Config

Contained is a generic list of about:config magic voo-doo that people should do
if they consider using Firefox. Some are *preferential* so keep that in mind.
Eventually this will be sorted out and users may choose to fork if they
want to keep their own changes.

These can be searched for manually or modified directly in via
[prefs.js](http://kb.mozillazine.org/Prefs.js_file), if one is careful enough.

## TODO
* Add in Firefox addons and other config.
